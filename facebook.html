        <h1>Facebook</h1>
        <h4>Facebook's MAF</h4>
        <p>
            The average MAF for each platform, with 90% confidence intervals, is
            <br><h3> 1. Facebook: 4.2 (3.5 - 5.0)
            Engagement definition is Reactions + Comments + Shares <br></h3>
            <br><h3>2. Instagram: 2.9 (2.4 - 3.5) 
            Engagement definition is Likes + Comments <br></h3>
            <br><h3>3. TikTok: 29 (9.5 - 91)
            Engagement definition is Views <br></h3>
            <br><h3>4. Twitter: 35 (25 - 51)
            Engagement definition is Favs + Replies + Retweets  <br></h3>
            <br><h3>5. YouTube: 6.1 (3.3 - 12)
            Engagement definition is Views  <br></h3>
            <br>
            We have a different number of fact checked posts for each platform. Facebook and Twitter have, by far, the largest number of fact checks on their content. This means that the MAF estimate for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube will always have significantly higher uncertainties. <br>

            <br> For Facebook and Twitter, we can look at how the MAF varies week to week, as well as the MAF distribution for all misinformation posts. <br>

            <br> We can also look at the time difference between when the misinformation content is posted and when the fact checks on them are published. We see that there is typically a substantial delay between the misinformation and fact check, which is only natural, since tracking down the truth takes time and effort. But this does mean that by the time the fact checks are published, the misinformation content has likely already gotten most of the engagement it ever would have. <br>

            <br> Studies suggest that the misinformation on social media typically gets 90% of its total engagement in less than one day, which means that for the majority of fact checked content, the fact check will come in after the post has already received the majority of its engagement. Facebook has a comprehensive program around “downranking” and limiting distribution of fact checked content, and yet still has a MAF of around four. This has a couple of implications. <br>

            <br> First, fact checkers need a full suite of tools and support from the platforms to help increase their efficiency if they are to be able to keep up with the speed of misinformation on the platforms.And second, fact checking existing content is not enough to stop the misinformation problem we see on platforms. Responsible design of platforms, in ways that work against misinformation and work for factual information, are another essential component. <br>

            <br> Fact checking programs are not ineffective. They help prevent misinformation from repeatedly going viral, get truth into the information ecosystem, and provide essential insights into the platforms. But they also cannot be the only tool we use to combat online misinformation. We need better platform design as well. <br>      
  
            <br> All social media platforms have a Misinformation Amplification Factor above 1, which means that on average misinformation gets more distribution on the platforms than more benign content. Again, this matches our basic expectation. However, we do see a wide range of MAF for different platforms.<br> 
            
            <br>Twitter and TikTok have the highest MAF. This is a reflection of strong mechanisms for “virality” on the platforms. On Twitter, the retweet feature has much less friction than other platforms’ sharing options. A tap and a confirmation is all that is required to retweet. For contrast, sharing a post on Facebook requires that a user pick which method they want to use to share it, either a direct message or new post, which leads to a new post prompt where there is an expectation to add commentary. The low friction sharing option on Twitter allows misinformation to spread far beyond the followers of the account that uploaded it.
            <br>

            <br> On TikTok, the vast majority of content is public, and most views are the result of recommendations of all public content on the platform. The recommendation system depends on machine learning models that are predicting engagement. This again means that misinformation can spread far beyond the followers of the account that created it, and that misinformation will perform well in the recommendation scores.


            <br> Instagram has the lowest MAF by quite a bit. This is likely a reflection of design choices that Instagram has made for the platform. There are few mechanisms for “virality” on the platform. Sharing and retweet-like features are limited to Stories, which means that most content in people's feeds is limited to accounts they follow. There are some surfaces and means for Instagram to show users “recommended” content from accounts they don’t follow, most notably Reels now, but those are limited, and thus misinformation going viral on the platform has a more limited effect on distribution. <br>

            <br>The MAF for Facebook lands closer to Instagram. While it does have sharing features, it simply isn’t used to the same extent that the retweet feature on Twitter is. This is likely due to both the higher friction for sharing on Facebook, as discussed above, as well as the cultural norms that have developed on Twitter, where retweeting is a much more common practice among the users.<br>

           <br> However, we do see signs that Facebook’s MAF may increase as the platform adds more TikTok like features and increases the role of recommended content. The pieces of misinformation on Facebook that have the highest individual MAFs, with MAFs ranging from 290 to 35,000, were all Reels. If we specifically look at video content on Facebook, we see a MAF of 14, which is significantly higher than Facebook overall. This is because Reels and Facebook Watch, which are key for video distribution on Facebook, both rely heavily on algorithmic content recommendations, which are engagement focused.<br>

           <p>So, as Facebook transitions more to Reels that are all recommended, we should expect the MAF of Facebook to increase and misinformation to perform better.</p>
